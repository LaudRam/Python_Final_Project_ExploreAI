## 1. Project Description <a class="anchor" id="project-description"></a>

This project explores globla deforestation, which is gradual or rapid removal of trees and vegetation, and conducts a thorough data analysis procedure on a dataset with the global forest area in square km. The main concern is the trend of this phenomena on a global scale between the years 1990 and 2021. Consequently, highlighting factors that contribute to the rate of deforestation or afforestation (increase in forest area) such as region and income levels. The key objectives explored are as follows:
* To perform exploratory data analysis of the global deforestation dataset.
* To analyse the change in global forest area from 1990 and 2021, identifying trends of deforestation or afforestation for each country.
* To identify countries, regions and income levels that have the largest decrease and increase in forest area between 1990 and 2021.
* To determine the relationship between income status and rate of deforestation.
* To determine the relationship between various regions and rate of deforestation.

The folowing structure is used for data analysis sequentially:
1. Importing packages
2. Data loading
3. Data cleaning
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
5. Conclusion and insight


## 2. Datasets <a class="anchor" id="dataset"></a>

The raw dataset used in the projec can be located [here] (Python_Final_Projec_ExploreAI/forest_area_km.csv). It consists of # coloumns and # rows, and has the follwing features:
* <b>Country_name</b>: list of country names, regions, and income statuses, with each element (country, region, income status) appearing as a distinct entry.
* <b>Country_code</b>: A three letter code that distinctively represents a country.:
* <b>1990</b>: total forest area in squared kilometers
    .
    .
    .
* <b>2021</b> : total forest area in squared kilometers

## 3. Packages <a class="anchor" id="packages"></a>


The following packages and libraries are essential for analysis and achieving the outlined objectives:

+ `numpy (2.0.1)`
+ `pandas (2.2.2)`
+ `seaborn (0.13.2)`
+ `matplotlib (version)`


## 4.Enivironment <a class="anchor" id="environment"></a>

The use of a virtual environment is encouraged.

###  Setting up environment


### Cloning Git repository

git steps to clone repo


### Installing packages in the environment

It is paramount that the libraries are installed on your enivironment before importing. Use the the package manager to install each as demosntrated below:
+ `pip install (package_name)`
    eg. `pip install numpy`
